# Health-Mart
I developed Health Mart, an innovative pharmacy management system. Built with Java, Apache NetBeans, and MySQL, it streamlines pharmacy operations.  Features:  Admin Dashboard: Manage users and update admin details. User Dashboard: Manage medicines, view bills. Sell Tab: Search medicines, adjust quantities, add to cart, generate/print bills.
